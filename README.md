# Meerkat Deep Learning Framework

![MeerkatDL](./misc/meerkatdl.png)

A Deep Learning Framework Just for Fun and Education! ðŸ¥³

Its purpose is to be a readable and quick to understand reference for building a library like PyTorch with Autodiff written completely in Python.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install meerkat_dl
```
